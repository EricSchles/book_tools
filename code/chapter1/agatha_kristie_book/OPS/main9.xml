THE ARREST</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian
who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to
London.</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in
London! Was it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already
made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier?</p>
<p>I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot
away, I was uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had
he not, in all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I
could not resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I
announce the arrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not
acknowledge it to myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was
weighing on me. Would it not be a terrible shock to her? For the
moment, I set aside utterly any suspicions of her. She could not be
implicated—otherwise I should have heard some hint of it.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to
conceal Dr. Bauerstein's arrest from her. It would be announced in
every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it
out. If only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his
advice. What possessed him to go posting off to London in this
unaccountable way?</p>
<p>In spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably
heightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had
not Poirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was
clever.</p>
<p>After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my
confidence, and leave him to make the matter public or not, as he
thought fit.</p>
<p>He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the
news.</p>
<p>"Great Scot! You <em>were</em> right, then. I couldn't believe
it at the time."</p>
<p>"No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see
how it makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course,
it will be generally known to-morrow."</p>
<p>John reflected.</p>
<p>"Never mind," he said at last, "we won't say anything at
present. There is no need. As you say, it will be known soon
enough."</p>
<p>But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next
morning, and eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word
about the arrest! There was a column of mere padding about "The
Styles Poisoning Case," but nothing further. It was rather
inexplicable, but I supposed that, for some reason or other, Japp
wished to keep it out of the papers. It worried me just a little,
for it suggested the possibility that there might be further
arrests to come.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if
Poirot had returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known
face blocked one of the windows, and the well-known voice said:</p>
<p>"Bon jour, mon ami!"</p>
<p>"Poirot," I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both
hands, I dragged him into the room. "I was never so glad to see
anyone. Listen, I have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that
right?"</p>
<p>"My friend," replied Poirot, "I do not know what you are talking
about."</p>
<p>"Dr. Bauerstein's arrest, of course," I answered
impatiently.</p>
<p>"Is Bauerstein arrested, then?"</p>
<p>"Did you not know it?"</p>
<p>"Not the least in the world." But, pausing a moment, he added:
"Still, it does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles
from the coast."</p>
<p>"The coast?" I asked, puzzled. "What has that got to do with
it?"</p>
<p>Poirot shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Surely, it is obvious!"</p>
<p>"Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the
proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.
Inglethorp."</p>
<p>"Nothing at all, of course," replied Poirot, smiling. "But we
were speaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein."</p>
<p>"Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp——"</p>
<p>"What?" cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. "Dr.
Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that,
my friend?"</p>
<p>"Well, no one exactly told me," I confessed. "But he is
arrested."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, mon ami."</p>
<p>"Espionage?" I gasped.</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?"</p>
<p>"Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,"
replied Poirot placidly.</p>
<p>"But—but I thought you thought so too?"</p>
<p>Poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and
his full sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say," I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new
idea, "that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?"</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>"Have you never suspected it?"</p>
<p>"It never entered my head."</p>
<p>"It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor
should bury himself in a little village like this, and should be in
the habit of walking about at all hours of the night, fully
dressed?"</p>
<p>"No," I confessed, "I never thought of such a thing."</p>
<p>"He is, of course, a German by birth," said Poirot thoughtfully,
"though he has practiced so long in this country that nobody thinks
of him as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about
fifteen years ago. A very clever man—a Jew, of course."</p>
<p>"The blackguard!" I cried indignantly.</p>
<p>"Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he
stands to lose. I admire the man myself."</p>
<p>But I could not look at it in Poirot's philosophical way.</p>
<p>"And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering
about all over the country!" I cried indignantly.</p>
<p>"Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful," remarked
Poirot. "So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names
together, any other vagaries of the doctor's passed
unobserved."</p>
<p>"Then you think he never really cared for her?" I asked
eagerly—rather too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.</p>
<p>"That, of course, I cannot say, but—shall I tell you my own
private opinion, Hastings?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never
has cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!"</p>
<p>"Do you really think so?" I could not disguise my pleasure.</p>
<p>"I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Because she cares for some one else, mon ami."</p>
<p>"Oh!" What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth
spread over me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but
I remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,
perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate——</p>
<p>My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of
Miss Howard. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no
one else in the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown
paper. This she handed to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the
cryptic words:</p>
<p>"On top of the wardrobe." Then she hurriedly left the room.</p>
<p>Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an
exclamation of satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.</p>
<p>"Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial—J. or
L.?"</p>
<p>It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it
had lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting
Poirot's attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of
Messrs. Parkson's, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was
addressed to "—(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles
Court, Styles St. Mary, Essex."</p>
<p>"It might be T., or it might be L.," I said, after studying the
thing for a minute or two. "It certainly isn't a J."</p>
<p>"Good," replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. "I, also, am
of your way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!"</p>
<p>"Where did it come from?" I asked curiously. "Is it
important?"</p>
<p>"Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced
its existence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see,
she has been successful."</p>
<p>"What did she mean by 'On the top of the wardrobe'?"</p>
<p>"She meant," replied Poirot promptly, "that she found it on top
of a wardrobe."</p>
<p>"A funny place for a piece of brown paper," I mused.</p>
<p>"Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for
brown paper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself.
Neatly arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye."</p>
<p>"Poirot," I asked earnestly, "have you made up your mind about
this crime?"</p>
<p>"Yes—that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——"
With sudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down
the hall, calling out in French in his excitement: "Mademoiselle
Dorcas, Mademoiselle Dorcas, un moment, s'il vous plait!"</p>
<p>Dorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the
pantry.</p>
<p>"My good Dorcas, I have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove
justified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not
Tuesday, Dorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did
anything go wrong with Mrs. Inglethorp's bell?"</p>
<p>Dorcas looked very surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don't know how
you came to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled
the wire through. The man came and put it right on Tuesday
morning."</p>
<p>With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way
back to the morning-room.</p>
<p>"See you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should
be enough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that
one is on the right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant
refreshed. I run! I leap!"</p>
<p>And, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down
the stretch of lawn outside the long window.</p>
<p>"What is your remarkable little friend doing?" asked a voice
behind me, and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She
smiled, and so did I. "What is it all about?"</p>
<p>"Really, I can't tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a
bell, and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering
about as you see!"</p>
<p>Mary laughed.</p>
<p>"How ridiculous! He's going out of the gate. Isn't he coming
back to-day?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I've given up trying to guess what he'll do
next."</p>
<p>"Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?"</p>
<p>"I honestly don't know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a
hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is
method in his madness."</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>In spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning.
She seemed grave, almost sad.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle
her on the subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, I thought,
but I had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.</p>
<p>"You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings,
but in this case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will
run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me."</p>
<p>I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn't thought—But
again she stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they
quite drove Cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hastings," she said, "do you think I and my husband are
happy together?"</p>
<p>I was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about
it's not being my business to think anything of the sort.</p>
<p>"Well," she said quietly, "whether it is your business or not, I
will tell you that we are <em>not</em> happy."</p>
<p>I said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.</p>
<p>She began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a
little bent, and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as
she walked. She stopped suddenly, and looked up at me.</p>
<p>"You don't know anything about me, do you?" she asked. "Where I
come from, who I was before I married John—anything, in fact? Well,
I will tell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are
kind, I think—yes, I am sure you are kind."</p>
<p>Somehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I
remembered that Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same
way. Besides, a father confessor should be elderly, it is not at
all the role for a young man.</p>
<p>"My father was English," said Mrs. Cavendish, "but my mother was
a Russian."</p>
<p>"Ah," I said, "now I understand—"</p>
<p>"Understand what?"</p>
<p>"A hint of something foreign—different—that there has always
been about you."</p>
<p>"My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don't know, because
I never saw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I
believe there was some tragedy connected with her death—she took an
overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake. However that may be,
my father was broken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the
Consular Service. Everywhere he went, I went with him. When I was
twenty-three, I had been nearly all over the world. It was a
splendid life—I loved it."</p>
<p>There was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She
seemed living in the memory of those old glad days.</p>
<p>"Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and
live with some old aunts in Yorkshire." She shuddered. "You will
understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl
brought up as I had been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of
it, almost drove me mad." She paused a minute, and added in a
different tone: "And then I met John Cavendish."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"You can imagine that, from my aunts' point of view, it was a
very good match for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact
which weighed with me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the
insufferable monotony of my life."</p>
<p>I said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told
him, what was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to
come to like him more, but that I was not in any way what the world
calls 'in love' with him. He declared that that satisfied him, and
so—we were married."</p>
<p>She waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her
forehead. She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past
days.</p>
<p>"I think—I am sure—he cared for me at first. But I suppose we
were not well matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He—it is
not a pleasing thing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me
very soon." I must have made some murmur of dissent, for she went
on quickly: "Oh, yes, he did! Not that it matters now—now that
we've come to the parting of the ways."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>She answered quietly:</p>
<p>"I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles."</p>
<p>"You and John are not going to live here?"</p>
<p>"John may live here, but I shall not."</p>
<p>"You are going to leave him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>She paused a long time, and said at last:</p>
<p>"Perhaps—because I want to be—free!"</p>
<p>And, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin
tracts of forests, untrodden lands—and a realization of what
freedom would mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to
see her for a moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed
by civilization as some shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke
from her lips:</p>
<p>"You don't know, you don't know, how this hateful place has been
prison to me!"</p>
<p>"I understand," I said, "but—but don't do anything rash."</p>
<p>"Oh, rash!" Her voice mocked at my prudence.</p>
<p>Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue
for:</p>
<p>"You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?"</p>
<p>An instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting
out all expression.</p>
<p>"John was so kind as to break that to me this morning."</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think?" I asked feebly.</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"Of the arrest?"</p>
<p>"What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the
gardener had told John."</p>
<p>Her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did
she care, or did she not?</p>
<p>She moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower
vases.</p>
<p>"These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind
moving—thank you, Mr. Hastings." And she walked quietly past me out
of the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.</p>
<p>No, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act
her part with that icy unconcern.</p>
<p>Poirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and
there was no sign of the Scotland Yard men.</p>
<p>But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or
rather lack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth
letter, which Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding
her death. Our efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the
matter, hoping that it might turn up of itself one day. And this is
just what did happen, in the shape of a communication, which
arrived by the second post from a firm of French music publishers,
acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp's cheque, and regretting they had
been unable to trace a certain series of Russian folksongs. So the
last hope of solving the mystery, by means of Mrs. Inglethorp's
correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>Just before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new
disappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more
out.</p>
<p>"Gone to London again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. 'To
see a young lady's dispensary,' he said."</p>
<p>"Silly ass!" I ejaculated. "I told him Wednesday was the one day
she wasn't there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning,
will you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, monsieur."</p>
<p>But, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting
angry. He was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.</p>
<p>After lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going
down to see him.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to
see us."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous
and excited in his manner roused my curiosity.</p>
<p>"What is it?" I asked. "I could go if there's anything
special."</p>
<p>"It's nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell
him—" he dropped his voice to a whisper—"I think I've found the
extra coffee-cup!"</p>
<p>I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot's, but
now my curiosity was aroused afresh.</p>
<p>Lawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend
from my high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways
Cottage.</p>
<p>This time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was
within. Would I mount? I mounted accordingly.</p>
<p>Poirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands.
He sprang up at my entrance.</p>
<p>"What is it?" I asked solicitously. "You are not ill, I
trust?"</p>
<p>"No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment."</p>
<p>"Whether to catch the criminal or not?" I asked facetiously.</p>
<p>But, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.</p>
<p>" 'To speak or not to speak,' as your so great Shakespeare says,
'that is the question.' "</p>
<p>I did not trouble to correct the quotation.</p>
<p>"You are not serious, Poirot?"</p>
<p>"I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things
hangs in the balance."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>"A woman's happiness, mon ami," he said gravely.</p>
<p>I did not quite know what to say.</p>
<p>"The moment has come," said Poirot thoughtfully, "and I do not
know what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play.
No one but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!" And he tapped
himself proudly on the breast.</p>
<p>After pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his
effect, I gave him Lawrence's message.</p>
<p>"Aha!" he cried. "So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is
good. He has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced
Monsieur Lawrence of yours!"</p>
<p>I did not myself think very highly of Lawrence's intelligence;
but I forebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task
for forgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia's days
off.</p>
<p>"It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other
young lady was most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and
showed me everything in the kindest way."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, that's all right, then, and you must go to tea with
Cynthia another day."</p>
<p>I told him about the letter.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for that," he said. "I always had hopes of that
letter. But no, it was not to be. This affair must all be
unravelled from within." He tapped his forehead. "These little grey
cells. It is 'up to them'—as you say over here." Then, suddenly, he
asked: "Are you a judge of finger-marks, my friend?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, rather surprised, "I know that there are no two
finger-marks alike, but that's as far as my science goes."</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>He unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which
he laid on the table.</p>
<p>"I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to
me?"</p>
<p>I studied the proofs attentively.</p>
<p>"All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man's
finger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady's; they are
much smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3"—I paused for
some time—"there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but
here, very distinctly, are No. 1's."</p>
<p>"Overlapping the others?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You recognize them beyond fail?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; they are identical."</p>
<p>Poirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked
them up again.</p>
<p>"I suppose," I said, "that as usual, you are not going to
explain?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur
Lawrence. No. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not
important. I merely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little
more complicated."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a
sort of blur extending all across the picture. I will not describe
to you the special apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used.
It is a well-known process to the police, and by means of it you
can obtain a photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a
very short space of time. Well, my friend, you have seen the
finger-marks—it remains to tell you the particular object on which
they had been left."</p>
<p>"Go on—I am really excited."</p>
<p>"Eh bien! Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of
a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the
Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster—which sounds like the house that
Jack built!"</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" I exclaimed. "But what were Lawrence Cavendish's
finger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard
the day we were there!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, he did!"</p>
<p>"Impossible! We were all together the whole time."</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head.</p>
<p>"No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all
together. There was a moment when you could not have been all
together, or it would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur
Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony."</p>
<p>"I'd forgotten that," I admitted. "But it was only for a
moment."</p>
<p>"Long enough."</p>
<p>"Long enough for what?"</p>
<p>Poirot's smile became rather enigmatical.</p>
<p>"Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to
gratify a very natural interest and curiosity."</p>
<p>Our eyes met. Poirot's were pleasantly vague. He got up and
hummed a little tune. I watched him suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Poirot," I said, "what was in this particular little
bottle?"</p>
<p>Poirot looked out of the window.</p>
<p>"Hydro-chloride of strychnine," he said, over his shoulder,
continuing to hum.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I
had expected that answer.</p>
<p>"They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—
only occasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq.
Strychnine Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why
the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then."</p>
<p>"How did you manage to take this photograph?"</p>
<p>"I dropped my hat from the balcony," explained Poirot simply.
"Visitors were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my
many apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia's colleague had to go down and
fetch it for me."</p>
<p>"Then you knew what you were going to find?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from
your story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The
possibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated."</p>
<p>"Poirot," I said, "your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a
very important discovery."</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Poirot. "But one thing does strike me. No
doubt it has struck you too."</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this
case. This is the third time we run up against it. There was
strychnine in Mrs. Inglethorp's tonic. There is the strychnine sold
across the counter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more
strychnine, handled by one of the household. It is confusing; and,
as you know, I do not like confusion."</p>
<p>Before I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door
and stuck his head in.</p>
<p>"There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings."</p>
<p>"A lady?"</p>
<p>I jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary
Cavendish was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>"I have been visiting an old woman in the village," she
explained, "and as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I
thought I would call for you."</p>
<p>"Alas, madame," said Poirot, "I thought you had come to honour
me with a visit!"</p>
<p>"I will some day, if you ask me," she promised him, smiling.</p>
<p>"That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame"
—she started ever so slightly—"remember, Papa Poirot is always at
your service."</p>
<p>She stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read
some deeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly
away.</p>
<p>"Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?"</p>
<p>"Enchanted, madame."</p>
<p>All the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It
struck me that in some way she was nervous of Poirot's eyes.</p>
<p>The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal
in its shrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black
sports coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful
noise, like some great giant sighing.</p>
<p>We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the
knowledge came to us that something was wrong.</p>
<p>Dorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing
her hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the
background, all eyes and ears.</p>
<p>"Oh, m'am! Oh, m'am! I don't know how to tell you—"</p>
<p>"What is it, Dorcas?" I asked impatiently. "Tell us at
once."</p>
<p>"It's those wicked detectives. They've arrested him—they've
arrested Mr. Cavendish!"</p>
<p>"Arrested Lawrence?" I gasped.</p>
<p>I saw a strange look come into Dorcas's eyes.</p>
<p>"No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence—Mr. John."</p>
<p>Behind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against
me, and as I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in
Poirot's eyes.</p>
