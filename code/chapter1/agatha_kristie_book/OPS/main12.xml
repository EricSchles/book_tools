POIROT EXPLAINS</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>"Poirot, you old villain," I said, "I've half a mind to strangle
you! What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?"</p>
<p>We were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind
us. In the room below, John and Mary were together once more, while
Alfred Inglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I
had Poirot to myself, and could relieve my still burning
curiosity.</p>
<p>Poirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:</p>
<p>"I did not deceive you, mon ami. At most, I permitted you to
deceive yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes, but why?"</p>
<p>"Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have
a nature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that—enfin,
to conceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas,
the very first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute
gentleman would have—in your so expressive idiom—'smelt a rat'! And
then, bon jour to our chances of catching him!"</p>
<p>"I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit
for."</p>
<p>"My friend," besought Poirot, "I implore you, do not enrage
yourself! Your help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the
extremely beautiful nature that you have, which made me pause."</p>
<p>"Well," I grumbled, a little mollified. "I still think you might
have given me a hint."</p>
<p>"But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them.
Think now, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish
guilty? Did I not, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost
certainly be acquitted?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but——"</p>
<p>"And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of
bringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I
was speaking of two entirely different persons?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "it was not plain to me!"</p>
<p>"Then again," continued Poirot, "at the beginning, did I not
repeat to you several times that I didn't want Mr. Inglethorp
arrested <em>now</em>? That should have conveyed something to
you."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?"</p>
<p>"Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs.
Inglethorp's death, her husband would benefit the most. There was
no getting away from that. When I went up to Styles with you that
first day, I had no idea as to how the crime had been committed,
but from what I knew of Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be
very hard to find anything to connect him with it. When I arrived
at the chateau, I realized at once that it was Mrs. Inglethorp who
had burnt the will; and there, by the way, you cannot complain, my
friend, for I tried my best to force on you the significance of
that bedroom fire in midsummer."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," I said impatiently. "Go on."</p>
<p>"Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp's
guilt were very much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence
against him that I was inclined to believe that he had not done
it."</p>
<p>"When did you change your mind?"</p>
<p>"When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the
more efforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I
discovered that Inglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and
that in fact it was John Cavendish who was interested in that
quarter, I was quite sure."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>"Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an
intrigue with Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly
comprehensible. But, when I discovered that it was known all over
the village that it was John who was attracted by the farmer's
pretty wife, his silence bore quite a different interpretation. It
was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal, as no
possible scandal could attach to him. This attitude of his gave me
furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that
Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. Eh bien! from that moment,
I was equally determined that he should not be arrested."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. I don't see why he wished to be arrested?"</p>
<p>"Because, mon ami, it is the law of your country that a man once
acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but
it was clever—his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here,
he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he
conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of
manufactured evidence against himself. He wished to be arrested. He
would then produce his irreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was
safe for life!"</p>
<p>"But I still don't see how he managed to prove his alibi, and
yet go to the chemist's shop?"</p>
<p>Poirot stared at me in surprise.</p>
<p>"Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that
it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist's shop?"</p>
<p>"Miss Howard?"</p>
<p>"But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a
good height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she
and Inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance
between them, especially in their gait and bearing. It was
simplicity itself. They are a clever pair!"</p>
<p>"I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide
business was done," I remarked.</p>
<p>"Bon! I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am
inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that
affair. You remember her once mentioning that her father was a
doctor? Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him, or she may
have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when
Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her exam. Anyway, she was
familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture
containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter.
Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a
box of bromide powders, which she occasionally took at night. What
could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those
powders in Mrs. Inglethorp's large sized bottle of medicine when it
came from Coot's? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not
take place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen
either of them touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it
by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and
departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her absence, will
defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they had left
it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought
home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too
clever—and that was their undoing."</p>
<p>Poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the
ceiling.</p>
<p>"They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by
buying strychnine at the village chemist's, and signing the
register in his hand-writing.</p>
<p>"On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her
medicine. On Monday, therefore, at six o'clock, Alfred Inglethorp
arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed
from the village. Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and
bull story about him and Mrs. Raikes to account for his holding his
tongue afterwards. At six o'clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred
Inglethorp, enters the chemist's shop, with her story about a dog,
obtains the strychnine, and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in
John's handwriting, which she had previously studied carefully.</p>
<p>"But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she
writes him an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing —which
takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that
anyone will see him.</p>
<p>"So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham.
Alfred Inglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can
compromise him in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the
strychnine, which, after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw
suspicion on John Cavendish.</p>
<p>"But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her
medicine that night. The broken bell, Cynthia's absence— arranged
by Inglethorp through his wife—all these are wasted. And then—he
makes his slip.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his
accomplice, who, he fears, may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of
their plan. It is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier
than he expected. Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he
hastily shuts and locks his desk. He fears that if he remains in
the room he may have to open it again, and that Mrs. Inglethorp
might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up. So he
goes out and walks in the woods, little dreaming that Mrs.
Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the incriminating
document.</p>
<p>"But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads
it, and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn
Howard, though, unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides
conveys no warning to her mind. She knows that she is in danger—but
is ignorant of where the danger lies. She decides to say nothing to
her husband, but sits down and writes to her solicitor, asking him
to come on the morrow, and she also determines to destroy
immediately the will which she has just made. She keeps the fatal
letter."</p>
<p>"It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced
the lock of the despatch-case?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he
realized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely
nothing to connect him with the crime."</p>
<p>"There's only one thing I can't make out, why didn't he destroy
it at once when he got hold of it?"</p>
<p>"Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of
keeping it on his own person."</p>
<p>"I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there
were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the
five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for
before that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen
anyone who passed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the
scene! He enters the room, unlocking the door by means of one of
the other doorkeys—they were all much alike. He hurries to the
despatch-case—it is locked, and the keys are nowhere to be seen.
That is a terrible blow to him, for it means that his presence in
the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped. But he sees clearly
that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece
of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a penknife, and turns
over the papers until he finds what he is looking for.</p>
<p>"But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of
paper on him. He may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched.
If the paper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this
minute, too, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John
leaving the boudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this
terrible slip of paper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are
kept and in any case, are sure to be examined. There are no means
of destroying it; and he dare not keep it. He looks round, and he
sees—what do you think, mon ami?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and
rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst
the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece."</p>
<p>I uttered an exclamation.</p>
<p>"No one would think of looking there," Poirot continued. "And he
will be able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this
solitary piece of evidence against him."</p>
<p>"Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs.
Inglethorp's bedroom, under our very noses?" I cried.</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my 'last link,' and
I owe that very fortunate discovery to you."</p>
<p>"To me?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was
straightening the ornaments on the mantel-piece?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I don't see——"</p>
<p>"No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that
earlier in the morning, when we had been there together, I had
straightened all the objects on the mantel-piece. And, if they were
already straightened, there would be no need to straighten them
again, unless, in the meantime, some one else had touched
them."</p>
<p>"Dear me," I murmured, "so that is the explanation of your
extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it
still there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and it was a race for time."</p>
<p>"But I still can't understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as
to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy
it."</p>
<p>"Ah, but he had no opportunity. I saw to that."</p>
<p>"You?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into
my confidence on the subject?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not
sure then if Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I
reasoned that he would not have the paper on him, but would have
hidden it somewhere, and by enlisting the sympathy of the household
I could effectually prevent his destroying it. He was already under
suspicion, and by making the matter public I secured the services
of about ten amateur detectives, who would be watching him
unceasingly, and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would
not dare seek further to destroy the document. He was therefore
forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill vase."</p>
<p>"But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding
him."</p>
<p>"Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper's existence. In
accordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred
Inglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John
Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a
meeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping
that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he
was too clever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it
was; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week,
it was not likely they would do so afterwards. But for your lucky
remark, we might never have been able to bring him to justice."</p>
<p>"I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect
Miss Howard?"</p>
<p>"When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about
the letter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp."</p>
<p>"Why, what was there to lie about?"</p>
<p>"You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?"</p>
<p>"Yes—more or less."</p>
<p>"You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very
distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words.
But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will
notice that 'July 17th' is quite different in this respect. Do you
see what I mean?"</p>
<p>"No," I confessed, "I don't."</p>
<p>"You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th,
but on the 7th—the day after Miss Howard's departure? The '1' was
written in before the '7' to turn it into the '17th'."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>"That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard
suppress the letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one
instead? Because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th.
Why, again? And at once a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will
remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were
not telling you the truth."</p>
<p>"And yet," I cried indignantly, "after that, you gave me two
reasons why Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!"</p>
<p>"And very good reasons too," replied Poirot. "For a long time
they were a stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very
significant fact: that she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She
could not have committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons
against that did not debar her from being an accomplice. And, then,
there was that rather over-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a
very opposite emotion. There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion
between them long before he came to Styles. They had already
arranged their infamous plot—that he should marry this rich, but
rather foolish old lady, induce her to make a will leaving her
money to him, and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived
crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would probably have
left England, and lived together on their poor victim's money.</p>
<p>"They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion
was to be directed against him, she would be making quiet
preparations for a very different denouement. She arrives from
Middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession. No
suspicion attaches to her. No notice is paid to her coming and
going in the house. She hides the strychnine and glasses in John's
room. She puts the beard in the attic. She will see to it that
sooner or later they are duly discovered."</p>
<p>"I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John," I
remarked. "It would have been much easier for them to bring the
crime home to Lawrence."</p>
<p>"Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him
arose out of pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly
annoying to the pair of schemers."</p>
<p>"His manner was unfortunate," I observed thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia
guilty of the crime?"</p>
<p>"No," I exclaimed, astonished. "Impossible!"</p>
<p>"Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my
mind when I asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will.
Then there were the bromide powders which she had made up, and her
clever male impersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There
was really more evidence against her than anyone else."</p>
<p>"You are joking, Poirot!"</p>
<p>"No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale
when he first entered his mother's room on the fatal night? It was
because, whilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw,
over your shoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room
was unbolted."</p>
<p>"But he declared that he saw it bolted!" I cried.</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Poirot dryly. "And that was just what confirmed
my suspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle
Cynthia."</p>
<p>"But why should he shield her?"</p>
<p>"Because he is in love with her."</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>"There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact
that, far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes
her."</p>
<p>"Who told you that, mon ami?"</p>
<p>"Cynthia herself."</p>
<p>"La pauvre petite! And she was concerned?"</p>
<p>"She said that she did not mind at all."</p>
<p>"Then she certainly did mind very much," remarked Poirot. "They
are like that—les femmes!"</p>
<p>"What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me," I
said.</p>
<p>"But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make
the sour face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed
with his brother? He had taken it into his long head that
Mademoiselle Cynthia was in love with Monsieur John. When he
entered his mother's room, and saw her obviously poisoned, he
jumped to the conclusion that Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something
about the matter. He was nearly driven desperate. First he crushed
the coffee-cup to powder under his feet, remembering that
<em>she</em> had gone up with his mother the night before, and he
determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents.
Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld the
theory of 'Death from natural causes'."</p>
<p>"And what about the 'extra coffee-cup'?"</p>
<p>"I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden
it, but I had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all
what I meant; but, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if
he could find an extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be
cleared of suspicion. And he was perfectly right."</p>
<p>"One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying
words?"</p>
<p>"They were, of course, an accusation against her husband."</p>
<p>"Dear me, Poirot," I said with a sigh, "I think you have
explained everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even
John and his wife are reconciled."</p>
<p>"Thanks to me."</p>
<p>"How do you mean—thanks to you?"</p>
<p>"My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and
solely the trial which has brought them together again? That John
Cavendish still loved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was
equally in love with him. But they had drifted very far apart. It
all arose from a misunderstanding. She married him without love. He
knew it. He is a sensitive man in his way, he would not force
himself upon her if she did not want him. And, as he withdrew, her
love awoke. But they are both unusually proud, and their pride held
them inexorably apart. He drifted into an entanglement with Mrs.
Raikes, and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of Dr.
Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of John Cavendish's arrest,
when you found me deliberating over a big decision?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I quite understood your distress."</p>
<p>"Pardon me, mon ami, but you did not understand it in the least.
I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish
at once. I could have cleared him—though it might have meant a
failure to convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the
dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment—which partly
accounts for my success."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being
brought to trial?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of 'a
woman's happiness'. Nothing but the great danger through which they
have passed could have brought these two proud souls together
again."</p>
<p>I looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of
the little man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a
trial for murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!</p>
<p>"I perceive your thoughts, mon ami," said Poirot, smiling at me.
"No one but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And
you are wrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one
woman is the greatest thing in all the world."</p>
<p>His words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as
she lay white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening.
There had come the sound of the bell below. She had started up.
Poirot had opened the door, and meeting her agonized eyes had
nodded gently. "Yes, madame," he said. "I have brought him back to
you." He had stood aside, and as I went out I had seen the look in
Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had caught his wife in his arms.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are right, Poirot," I said gently. "Yes, it is the
greatest thing in the world."</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped
in.</p>
<p>"I—I only——"</p>
<p>"Come in," I said, springing up.</p>
<p>She came in, but did not sit down.</p>
<p>"I—only wanted to tell you something——"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>Cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then,
suddenly exclaiming: "You dears!" kissed first me and then Poirot,
and rushed out of the room again.</p>
<p>"What on earth does this mean?" I asked, surprised.</p>
<p>It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of
the salute rather impaired the pleasure.</p>
<p>"It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not
dislike her as much as she thought," replied Poirot
philosophically.</p>
<p>"But——"</p>
<p>"Here he is."</p>
<p>Lawrence at that moment passed the door.</p>
<p>"Eh! Monsieur Lawrence," called Poirot. "We must congratulate
you, is it not so?"</p>
<p>Lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a
sorry spectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>"What is it, mon ami?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said sadly. "They are two delightful women!"</p>
<p>"And neither of them is for you?" finished Poirot. "Never mind.
Console yourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows?
And then——"</p>
