<p>Agatha Mary Clarissa, Lady Mallowan, DBE (15 September 1890 – 12
January 1976), commonly known as Agatha Christie, was an English
crime fiction writer. She also wrote romance novels under the name
Mary Westmacott, but is best remembered for her 80 detective novels
and her successful West End theatre plays. Her works, particularly
featuring detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple, have given
her the title the 'Queen of Crime' and made her one of the most
important and innovative writers in the development of the genre.
Christie has been called — by the Guinness Book of World Records,
among others — the best-selling writer of books of all time, and
the best-selling writer of any kind together with William
Shakespeare. Only the Bible sold more with about 6 billion copies.
An estimated four billion copies of her novels have been sold.
UNESCO states that she is currently the most translated individual
author in the world with only the collective corporate works of
Walt Disney Productions superseding her. As an example of her broad
appeal, she is the all-time best-selling author in France, with
over 40 million copies sold in French (as of 2003) versus 22
million for Emile Zola, the nearest contender. Her stage play, The
Mousetrap, holds the record for the longest initial run in the
world, opening at the Ambassadors Theatre in London on 25 November
1952, and as of 2007 is still running after more than 20,000
performances. In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the
Mystery Writers of America's highest honor, the Grand Master Award,
and in the same year, Witness for the Prosecution was given an
Edgar Award by the MWA, for Best Play. Most of her books and short
stories have been filmed, some many times over (Murder on the
Orient Express, Death on the Nile, 4.50 From Paddington), and many
have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics. In
1998, the control of the rights to most of the literary works of
Agatha Christie passed to the company Chorion, when it purchased a
majority 64% share in Agatha Christie Limited. Source:
