POIROT INVESTIGATES</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite
close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow
path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the
winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly
reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running
figure of a man approaching me. It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he
been? How did he intend to explain his absence?</p>
<p>He accosted me eagerly.</p>
<p>"My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just
heard."</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Denby kept me late last night. It was one o'clock before we'd
finished. Then I found that I'd forgotten the latch-key after all.
I didn't want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed."</p>
<p>"How did you hear the news?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so
self-sacrificing—such a noble character. She over-taxed her
strength."</p>
<p>A wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite
the man was!</p>
<p>"I must hurry on," I said, thankful that he did not ask me
whither I was bound.</p>
<p>In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways
Cottage.</p>
<p>Getting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window
above me was cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.</p>
<p>He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief
words, I explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted
his help.</p>
<p>"Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me
the affair whilst I dress."</p>
<p>In a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up
to his room. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the
whole story, keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance,
however insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and
deliberate toilet.</p>
<p>I told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words, of
her husband's absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap
of conversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had
overheard, of the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn
Howard, and of the latter's innuendoes.</p>
<p>I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several
times, and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had
forgotten. Poirot smiled kindly on me.</p>
<p>"The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, mon ami. You are
agitated; you are excited—it is but natural. Presently, when we are
calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper
place. We will examine—and reject. Those of importance we will put
on one side; those of no importance, pouf!"—he screwed up his
cherub-like face, and puffed comically enough—"blow them away!"</p>
<p>"That's all very well," I objected, "but how are you going to
decide what is important, and what isn't? That always seems the
difficulty to me."</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his
moustache with exquisite care.</p>
<p>"Not so. Voyons! One fact leads to another—so we continue. Does
the next fit in with that? A merveille! Good! We can proceed. This
next little fact—no! Ah, that is curious! There is something
missing—a link in the chain that is not there. We examine. We
search. And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little
detail that will not tally, we put it here!" He made an extravagant
gesture with his hand. "It is significant! It is tremendous!"</p>
<p>"Y—es—"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I
quailed before it. "Beware! Peril to the detective who says: 'It is
so small—it does not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.'
That way lies confusion! Everything matters."</p>
<p>"I know. You always told me that. That's why I have gone into
all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or
not."</p>
<p>"And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have
given me the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present
them, I say nothing—truly, it is deplorable! But I make
allowances—you are upset. To that I attribute the circumstance that
you have omitted one fact of paramount importance."</p>
<p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last
night."</p>
<p>I stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man's
brain. He was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting
it on, and seemed wholly engrossed in the task.</p>
<p>"I don't remember," I said. "And, anyway, I don't see——"</p>
<p>"You do not see? But it is of the first importance."</p>
<p>"I can't see why," I said, rather nettled. "As far as I can
remember, she didn't eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had
taken her appetite away. That was only natural."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Poirot thoughtfully, "it was only natural."</p>
<p>He opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then
turned to me.</p>
<p>"Now I am ready. We will proceed to the chateau, and study
matters on the spot. Excuse me, mon ami, you dressed in haste, and
your tie is on one side. Permit me." With a deft gesture, he
rearranged it.</p>
<p>"Ca y est! Now, shall we start?"</p>
<p>We hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates.
Poirot stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the
beautiful expanse of park, still glittering with morning dew.</p>
<p>"So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged
in sorrow, prostrated with grief."</p>
<p>He looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I
reddened under his prolonged gaze.</p>
<p>Was the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs.
Inglethorp's death so great? I realized that there was an emotional
lack in the atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of
commanding love. Her death was a shock and a distress, but she
would not be passionately regretted.</p>
<p>Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head
gravely.</p>
<p>"No, you are right," he said, "it is not as though there was a
blood tie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but
she was not their own mother. Blood tells—always remember
that—blood tells."</p>
<p>"Poirot," I said, "I wish you would tell me why you wanted to
know if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it
over in my mind, but I can't see how it has anything to do with the
matter?"</p>
<p>He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but
finally he said:</p>
<p>"I do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my
habit to explain until the end is reached. The present contention
is that Mrs. Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably
administered in her coffee."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Well, what time was the coffee served?"</p>
<p>"About eight o'clock."</p>
<p>"Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—
certainly not much later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid
poison. Its effects would be felt very soon, probably in about an
hour. Yet, in Mrs. Inglethorp's case, the symptoms do not manifest
themselves until five o'clock the next morning: nine hours! But a
heavy meal, taken at about the same time as the poison, might
retard its effects, though hardly to that extent. Still, it is a
possibility to be taken into account. But, according to you, she
ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms do not develop
until early the next morning! Now that is a curious circumstance,
my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it. In the
meantime, remember it."</p>
<p>As we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face
looked weary and haggard.</p>
<p>"This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot," he said.
"Hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no
publicity?"</p>
<p>"I comprehend perfectly."</p>
<p>"You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go
upon."</p>
<p>"Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only."</p>
<p>John turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a
cigarette as he did so.</p>
<p>"You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I met him."</p>
<p>John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding
which was too much for Poirot's feelings. He retrieved it, and
buried it neatly.</p>
<p>"It's jolly difficult to know how to treat him."</p>
<p>"That difficulty will not exist long," pronounced Poirot
quietly.</p>
<p>John looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this
cryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had
given him to me.</p>
<p>"Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see."</p>
<p>"The rooms are locked?" asked Poirot.</p>
<p>"Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable."</p>
<p>Poirot nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for
us."</p>
<p>We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience
I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture
in it.</p>
<p>Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute
inspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with
the agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to
obliterate any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me
for my forbearance.</p>
<p>"What have you, my friend," he cried, "that you remain there
like—how do you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?"</p>
<p>I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any
foot-marks.</p>
<p>"Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been
practically an army in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to
find? No, come here and aid me in my search. I will put down my
little case until I need it."</p>
<p>He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an
ill-advised proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted
up, and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor.</p>
<p>"Eh voila une table!" cried Poirot. "Ah, my friend, one may live
in a big house and yet have no comfort."</p>
<p>After which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.</p>
<p>A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the
writing-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the
key from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing
peculiar, however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a
bit of twisted wire through the handle.</p>
<p>Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in,
assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went
to the door opposite leading into Cynthia's room. That door was
also bolted, as I had stated. However, he went to the length of
unbolting it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he
did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly
something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention. He
examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of
small forceps from his case, he drew out some minute particle which
he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.</p>
<p>On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and
a small saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained
in the saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk
out of stood near it.</p>
<p>I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook
this. Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his
finger into liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.</p>
<p>"Coco—with—I think—rum in it."</p>
<p>He passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the
bed had been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a
bunch of keys, and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay
scattered about.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is curious," said Poirot.</p>
<p>"I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about
it."</p>
<p>"You do not? Observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two
places; they lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is
absolutely smashed to powder."</p>
<p>"Well," I said wearily, "I suppose some one must have stepped on
it."</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Poirot, in an odd voice. "Some one stepped on
it."</p>
<p>He rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the
mantelpiece, where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments,
and straightening them—a trick of his when he was agitated.</p>
<p>"Mon ami," he said, turning to me, "somebody stepped on that
cup, grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either
because it contained strychnine or—which is far more
serious—because it did not contain strychnine!"</p>
<p>I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no
good asking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself,
and went on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys
from the floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally
selected one, very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock
of the purple despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but
after a moment's hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped
the bunch of keys, as well as the key that had originally stood in
the lock, into his own pocket.</p>
<p>"I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should
be done—at once!"</p>
<p>He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the
wash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round
stain, hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest
him particularly. He went down on his knees, examining it
minutely—even going so far as to smell it.</p>
<p>Finally, he poured a few drops of the coco into a test tube,
sealing it up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a
little notebook.</p>
<p>"We have found in this room," he said, writing busily, "six
points of interest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you," I replied hastily.</p>
<p>"Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into
powder; two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain
on the floor."</p>
<p>"That may have been done some time ago," I interrupted.</p>
<p>"No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee.
Four, a fragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two,
but recognizable."</p>
<p>"Ah!" I cried. "That was what you sealed up in the
envelope."</p>
<p>"Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp's
own dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five,
<em>this</em>!" With a dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large
splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table. "It must
have been done since yesterday, otherwise a good housemaid would
have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron. One of
my best hats once—but that is not to the point."</p>
<p>"It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or
perhaps Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle."</p>
<p>"You brought only one candle into the room?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset.
He seemed to see something over here"—I indicated the
mantelpiece—"that absolutely paralysed him."</p>
<p>"That is interesting," said Poirot quickly. "Yes, it is
suggestive"—his eye sweeping the whole length of the wall—"but it
was not his candle that made this great patch, for you perceive
that this is white grease; whereas Monsieur Lawrence's candle,
which is still on the dressing-table, is pink. On the other hand,
Mrs. Inglethorp had no candlestick in the room, only a
reading-lamp."</p>
<p>"Then," I said, "what do you deduce?"</p>
<p>To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging
me to use my own natural faculties.</p>
<p>"And the sixth point?" I asked. "I suppose it is the sample of
coco."</p>
<p>"No," said Poirot thoughtfully. "I might have included that in
the six, but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself
for the present."</p>
<p>He looked quickly round the room. "There is nothing more to be
done here, I think, unless"—he stared earnestly and long at the
dead ashes in the grate. "The fire burns—and it destroys. But by
chance—there might be—let us see!"</p>
<p>Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the
grate into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution.
Suddenly, he gave a faint exclamation.</p>
<p>"The forceps, Hastings!"</p>
<p>I quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a
small piece of half charred paper.</p>
<p>"There, mon ami!" he cried. "What do you think of that?"</p>
<p>I scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of
it:—</p>
<p>I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary
notepaper. Suddenly an idea struck me.</p>
<p>"Poirot!" I cried. "This is a fragment of a will!"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>I looked up at him sharply.</p>
<p>"You are not surprised?"</p>
<p>"No," he said gravely, "I expected it."</p>
<p>I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away
in his case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on
everything. My brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of
a will? Who had destroyed it? The person who had left the candle
grease on the floor? Obviously. But how had anyone gained
admission? All the doors had been bolted on the inside.</p>
<p>"Now, my friend," said Poirot briskly, "we will go. I should
like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid—Dorcas, her name is,
is it not?"</p>
<p>We passed through Alfred Inglethorp's room, and Poirot delayed
long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of
it. We went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.
Inglethorp's room as before.</p>
<p>I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to
see, and went myself in search of Dorcas.</p>
<p>When I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.</p>
<p>"Poirot," I cried, "where are you?"</p>
<p>"I am here, my friend."</p>
<p>He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing,
apparently lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower
beds.</p>
<p>"Admirable!" he murmured. "Admirable! What symmetry! Observe
that crescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye.
The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently
done; is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come
in—Dorcas is here."</p>
<p>"Eh bien, eh bien! Do not grudge me a moment's satisfaction of
the eye."</p>
<p>"Yes, but this affair is more important."</p>
<p>"And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal
importance?"</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if
he chose to take that line.</p>
<p>"You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come
in and interview the brave Dorcas."</p>
<p>Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of
her, and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She
was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.</p>
<p>In her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be
suspicious, but he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a
chair.</p>
<p>"Pray be seated, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>
<p>"You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Ten years, sir."</p>
<p>"That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much
attached to her, were you not?"</p>
<p>"She was a very good mistress to me, sir."</p>
<p>"Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put
them to you with Mr. Cavendish's full approval."</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly, sir."</p>
<p>"Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday
afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. But I don't know that I ought——" Dorcas hesitated.
Poirot looked at her keenly.</p>
<p>"My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail
of that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are
betraying your mistress's secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it
is necessary that we should know all—if we are to avenge her.
Nothing can bring her back to life, but we do hope, if there has
been foul play, to bring the murderer to justice."</p>
<p>"Amen to that," said Dorcas fiercely. "And, naming no names,
there's <em>one</em> in this house that none of us could ever
abide! And an ill day it was when first <em>he</em> darkened the
threshold."</p>
<p>Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming
his business-like tone, he asked:</p>
<p>"Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of
it?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside
yesterday——"</p>
<p>"What time was that?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't say exactly, sir, but it wasn't tea-time by a long
way. Perhaps four o'clock—or it may have been a bit later. Well,
sir, as I said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices
very loud and angry in here. I didn't exactly mean to listen,
but—well, there it is. I stopped. The door was shut, but the
mistress was speaking very sharp and clear, and I heard what she
said quite plainly. 'You have lied to me, and deceived me,' she
said. I didn't hear what Mr. Inglethorp replied. He spoke a good
bit lower than she did—but she answered: 'How dare you? I have kept
you and clothed you and fed you! You owe everything to me! And this
is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace upon our name!' Again I
didn't hear what he said, but she went on: 'Nothing that you can
say will make any difference. I see my duty clearly. My mind is
made up. You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal
between husband and wife will deter me.' Then I thought I heard
them coming out, so I went off quickly."</p>
<p>"You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp's voice you heard?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, sir, whose else's could it be?"</p>
<p>"Well, what happened next?"</p>
<p>"Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five
o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a
cup of tea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. She was looking
dreadful—so white and upset. 'Dorcas,' she says, 'I've had a great
shock.' 'I'm sorry for that, m'm,' I says. 'You'll feel better
after a nice hot cup of tea, m'm.' She had something in her hand. I
don't know if it was a letter, or just a piece of paper, but it had
writing on it, and she kept staring at it, almost as if she
couldn't believe what was written there. She whispered to herself,
as though she had forgotten I was there: 'These few words—and
everything's changed.' And then she says to me: 'Never trust a man,
Dorcas, they're not worth it!' I hurried off, and got her a good
strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said she'd feel better
when she'd drunk it. 'I don't know what to do,' she says. 'Scandal
between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas. I'd rather
hush it up if I could.' Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so she
didn't say any more."</p>
<p>"She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?"
"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that
purple case of hers."</p>
<p>"Is that where she usually kept important papers?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took
it up every night."</p>
<p>"When did she lose the key of it?"</p>
<p>"She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look
carefully for it. She was very much put out about it."</p>
<p>"But she had a duplicate key?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, sir."</p>
<p>Dorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth,
so was I. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.</p>
<p>"Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this
the key that was lost?" He drew from his pocket the key that he had
found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs.</p>
<p>Dorcas's eyes looked as though they would pop out of her
head.</p>
<p>"That's it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I
looked everywhere for it."</p>
<p>"Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it
was to-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a
dark green dress in her wardrobe?"</p>
<p>Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?"</p>
<p>Dorcas reflected.</p>
<p>"Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress."</p>
<p>"Light or dark green?"</p>
<p>"A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything
green?"</p>
<p>"No, sir—not that I know of."</p>
<p>Poirot's face did not betray a trace of whether he was
disappointed or otherwise. He merely remarked:</p>
<p>"Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to
believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder
last night?"</p>
<p>"Not <em>last</em> night, sir, I know she didn't."</p>
<p>"Why do you know so positively?"</p>
<p>"Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago,
and she didn't have any more made up."</p>
<p>"You are quite sure of that?"</p>
<p>"Positive, sir."</p>
<p>"Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn't ask
you to sign any paper yesterday?"</p>
<p>"To sign a paper? No, sir."</p>
<p>"When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening,
they found your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can
give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps
Annie could tell you, though she's a careless girl. Never cleared
the coffee-cups away last night. That's what happens when I'm not
here to look after things."</p>
<p>Poirot lifted his hand.</p>
<p>"Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer,
I pray you. I should like to examine them."</p>
<p>"Very well, sir."</p>
<p>"What time did you go out last evening?"</p>
<p>"About six o'clock, sir."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you." He rose and
strolled to the window. "I have been admiring these flower beds.
How many gardeners are employed here, by the way?"</p>
<p>"Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was
kept as a gentleman's place should be. I wish you could have seen
it then, sir. A fair sight it was. But now there's only old
Manning, and young William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in
breeches and such-like. Ah, these are dreadful times!"</p>
<p>"The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so.
Now, will you send Annie to me here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."</p>
<p>"How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?" I
asked, in lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. "And about the
lost key and the duplicate?"</p>
<p>"One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by
this." He suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists
use for powders.</p>
<p>"Where did you find it?"</p>
<p>"In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom. It was
Number Six of my catalogue."</p>
<p>"But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is
not of much importance?"</p>
<p>"Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as
peculiar about this box?"</p>
<p>I examined it closely.</p>
<p>"No, I can't say that I do."</p>
<p>"Look at the label."</p>
<p>I read the label carefully: " 'One powder to be taken at
bedtime, if required. Mrs. Inglethorp.' No, I see nothing
unusual."</p>
<p>"Not the fact that there is no chemist's name?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" I exclaimed. "To be sure, that is odd!"</p>
<p>"Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that,
without his printed name?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't say that I have."</p>
<p>I was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by
remarking:</p>
<p>"Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue
yourself, my friend."</p>
<p>An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had
no time to reply.</p>
<p>Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring
under intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment
of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Poirot came to the point at once, with a business-like
briskness.</p>
<p>"I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to
tell me something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last
night. How many were there? And can you tell me any of the names
and addresses?"</p>
<p>Annie considered.</p>
<p>"There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one
was to Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don't think I
remember, sir—oh, yes, one was to Ross's, the caterers in
Tadminster. The other one, I don't remember."</p>
<p>"Think," urged Poirot.</p>
<p>Annie racked her brains in vain.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, sir, but it's clean gone. I don't think I can have
noticed it."</p>
<p>"It does not matter," said Poirot, not betraying any sign of
disappointment. "Now I want to ask you about something else. There
is a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some coco in it. Did
she have that every night?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed
it up in the night—whenever she fancied it."</p>
<p>"What was it? Plain coco?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two
teaspoonfuls of rum in it."</p>
<p>"Who took it to her room?"</p>
<p>"I did, sir."</p>
<p>"Always?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"At what time?"</p>
<p>"When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir."</p>
<p>"Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, you see there's not much room on the gas stove, so
Cook used to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for
supper. Then I used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the
swing door, and take it into her room later."</p>
<p>"The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the
farther—servants' side?"</p>
<p>"It's this side, sir."</p>
<p>"What time did you bring it up last night?"</p>
<p>"About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir."</p>
<p>"And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp's room?"</p>
<p>"When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o'clock. Mrs.
Inglethorp came up to bed before I'd finished."</p>
<p>"Then, between 7.15 and 8 o'clock, the coco was standing on the
table in the left wing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir." Annie had been growing redder and redder in the
face, and now she blurted out unexpectedly:</p>
<p>"And if there <em>was</em> salt in it, sir, it wasn't me. I
never took the salt near it."</p>
<p>"What makes you think there was salt in it?" asked Poirot.</p>
<p>"Seeing it on the tray, sir."</p>
<p>"You saw some salt on the tray?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I
took the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress's
room I saw it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down
again, and asked Cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry,
because Dorcas was out, and I thought maybe the coco itself was all
right, and the salt had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off
with my apron, and took it in."</p>
<p>I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement.
Unknown to herself, Annie had provided us with an important piece
of evidence. How she would have gaped if she had realized that her
"coarse kitchen salt" was strychnine, one of the most deadly
poisons known to mankind. I marvelled at Poirot's calm. His
self-control was astonishing. I awaited his next question with
impatience, but it disappointed me.</p>
<p>"When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp's room, was the door leading
into Miss Cynthia's room bolted?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened."</p>
<p>"And the door into Mr. Inglethorp's room? Did you notice if that
was bolted too?"</p>
<p>Annie hesitated.</p>
<p>"I couldn't rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn't say
whether it was bolted or not."</p>
<p>"When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the
door after you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did
lock it at night. The door into the passage, that is."</p>
<p>"Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the
room yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn't have a
candle, only a reading-lamp."</p>
<p>"Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the
floor, you think you would have been sure to have seen it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of
blotting-paper and a hot iron."</p>
<p>Then Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:</p>
<p>"Did your mistress ever have a green dress?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports
coat?"</p>
<p>"Not green, sir."</p>
<p>"Nor anyone else in the house?"</p>
<p>Annie reflected.</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"You are sure of that?"</p>
<p>"Quite sure."</p>
<p>"Bien! That is all I want to know. Thank you very much."</p>
<p>With a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the
room. My pent-up excitement burst forth.</p>
<p>"Poirot," I cried, "I congratulate you! This is a great
discovery."</p>
<p>"What is a great discovery?"</p>
<p>"Why, that it was the coco and not the coffee that was poisoned.
That explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until
the early morning, since the coco was only drunk in the middle of
the night."</p>
<p>"So you think that the coco—mark well what I say, Hastings, the
coco—contained strychnine?"</p>
<p>"Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have
been?"</p>
<p>"It might have been salt," replied Poirot placidly.</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that
way, it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not
for the first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately
I thought it lucky that he had associated with him some one of a
more receptive type of mind.</p>
<p>Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>"You are not pleased with me, mon ami?"</p>
<p>"My dear Poirot," I said coldly, "it is not for me to dictate to
you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to
mine."</p>
<p>"A most admirable sentiment," remarked Poirot, rising briskly to
his feet. "Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is
the smaller desk in the corner?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Inglethorp's."</p>
<p>"Ah!" He tried the roll top tentatively. "Locked. But perhaps
one of Mrs. Inglethorp's keys would open it." He tried several,
twisting and turning them with a practiced hand, and finally
uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction. "Voila! It is not the key,
but it will open it at a pinch." He slid back the roll top, and ran
a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers. To my surprise, he did
not examine them, merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the
desk: "Decidedly, he is a man of method, this Mr. Inglethorp!"</p>
<p>A "man of method" was, in Poirot's estimation, the highest
praise that could be bestowed on any individual.</p>
<p>I felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on
disconnectedly:</p>
<p>"There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been,
eh, mon ami? There might have been? Yes"—his eyes wandered round
the room—"this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not
yield much. Only this."</p>
<p>He pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it
over to me. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty
looking old envelope with a few words scrawled across it,
apparently at random. The following is a facsimile of it.</p>
